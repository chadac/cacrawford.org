title: "My Workstation over the Years"
---

Apparently over the years I've gotten into heavily customizing my
workstation, and it pretty much all the photos I've taken over the
past decade or so. Since apparently I implicitly love my computers so
much, I thought I'd dedicate a page to them.

# 2014

## September - The University of Tulsa - Tulsa, OK

<img src="/photos/workstation/2014.jpg" style="border: 3px solid #EEE;" />

I'm pretty sure I was taking a picture of the Peanuts photo above my
desk. But you can at least still see my workstation setup: two
monitors, a bad keyboard, a mess on the desk (which is apparently the
only thing I keep consistent between photos) and Windows.

I was using Linux regularly at this time, but swapped to Windows for
gaming.

# 2015

## June - The University of Tulsa - Tulsa, OK

<img src="/photos/workstation/2015.png" style="border: 3px solid #EEE;" />

While living in Tulsa, Oklahoma at the University of Tulsa. The
machine on the right was a desktop that I had been using for years at
that point (I believe built in 2012) with specs I definitely don't
have any longer.

The desk came from the Container Store. My dad got it at a discount
since he worked for them in the web services department. Ended up
serving me for over 5 years.

At the time I was running on Xubuntu with Xmonad as my Window Manager
and only about a year later did I finally start recording my system
config in [some
dotfiles](https://github.com/chadac/dotfiles/tree/00d02ac521cd86e85043c622dee1ce525098ad63).

# 2018

## March - PhD studies - Tulsa, OK

<img src="/photos/workstation/2018-1.png" style="border: 3px solid #EEE;" />

Moved into my friend's house. It's the same machine but for some
stupid reason I replaced all of the fans with cheaper stuff that had
annoying lights. Added a new monitor, 144hx and 1440p.

By 2018 I was running on Arch Linux and using i3 as my WM.

## November - Still a postgrad - Tulsa, OK

<img src="/photos/workstation/2018-2.png" style="border: 3px solid #EEE;" />

Upgraded the speakers to bookshelf speakers, and since they didn't fit
on my tiny desk I had to raise them with some books. I moved out of
this place around February 2019.

# 2019

## April - Working at Exxon - The Woodlands, TX

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
<img src="/photos/workstation/2019-1.jpg" style="border: 3px solid #EEE; display: inline; float: left; margin: 0 10px 0 0;" height="400px"  />

A few months after I started work at Exxon. I got a nice L-shaped
standing desk, and it ended up being free as it came scratched Wayfair
didn't want to pay the return costs I guess. You can barely tell here
but this is three monitors.
</div>

## July - Working at Exxon - The Woodlands, TX

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">

A few months later, I added a rug. Looks quite a bit nicer I
think. Eventually I got a NAS (pictured bedlow) which eventually
turned into a whole setup.

<img src="/photos/workstation/2019-2.jpg" style="border: 3px solid #EEE; display: inline; float: right; margin: 0 0 0 10px; height: 400px;" />

</div>

<img src="/photos/workstation/2019-nas.jpg" style="border: 3px solid #EEE; margin: 10px 0 0 0;" />

## November - The mess grows... - The Woodlands, TX

Got yet another desktop for some stuff to run continuously, sitting on
top of my NAS. It was at this point that I realized I probably should
just buy a rack to store everything on top of.

# 2020

## January - The server rack - The Woodlands, TX

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; width: 100%;">

Put a server rack in my closet with an insanely loud switch that I
still use to this day. I got something ridiculous like 30U because I
was planning to add more to this stuff over time. Also added some HPE
nodes because I wanted something dedicated to run my virtual machines
that wasn't also a NAS.

## March - Cross country move! - Mercer Island, WA

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">

In March, I moved from Houston to the Seattle area in Washington to
work for Amazon. Funny enough, the week I started was also the week
everything shut down due to COVID. I never actually went in physically
to work for a year, although I think the move was still worth it. The
house was located on the border of Mercer Island, with a magnificent
view of Lake Washington and a close view of downtown. Perfect place to
work when I'm stuck at home all day. Although it took over a month to
unpack all of those boxes...

<img src="/photos/workstation/2020-the-new-view.jpg" style="display: inline; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; align: center; border: 3px solid #EEE; margin-top: 10px; height: 300px;" />

</div>

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
<img src="/photos/workstation/2020-the-new-place.jpg" style="border: 3px solid #EEE; width: 50%;" />
<img src="/photos/workstation/2020-the-move.jpg" style="border: 3px solid #EEE; width: 50%; border-left: 0;"  />
</div>

## March - The desk is set up! - Mercer Island, WA

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; width: 100%;">
<img src="/photos/workstation/2020-a-better-desk.jpg" style="margin-right: 10px; display: inline; border: 3px solid #EEE; width: 120%;" />
This was trimmed down to something more acceptable. Wire
management still needed some work, but fortunately...
</div>

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-top: 10px;">
...the server rack behind it was a convenient place to hide those
wires.  Effective wire hiding not pictured here.

<img src="/photos/workstation/2020-and-the-server.jpg" style="display: inline; border: 3px solid #EEE; width: 100%; float: left;" />
</div>

Nevertheless, there was something missing...

<center>
<img src="/photos/workstation/2020-pure-nonsense.jpg" style="border: 3px solid #EEE; width: 50%;" />
</center>

At this point I think I had gone off the deep end. Couldn't even sleep
because the switch fans were so loud. Was a nice source of heat,
though. Too bad it was summer.

## July - A return to some sanity - Mercer Island, WA

<img src="/photos/workstation/2020-some-sanity.jpg" style="border: 3px solid #EEE;" />

After a while I decided to move my server into a closet and swap my
desk so that I was facing some windows instead. That ended up looking
a lot better. I also added a record player to the whole situation,
which is admittedly a bit more useful to have nearby during work
compared to the server.

## August - Herman Miller addition - Mercer Island, WA

<img src="/photos/workstation/2020-herman-miller.jpg" style="border: 3px solid #EEE;" />

I found a very nice leather executive chair from a used seller in New
York. It makes a pretty nice addition to the whole desk setup, and was
fairly comfortable too. That old chair served me well, for something
like 8 years. It now sits in a basement for when I'm doing work down
there.

## January - Moving out again - Mercer Island, WA

<img src="/photos/workstation/2021-moving-out-again.jpg" style="border: 3px solid #EEE;" />

As soon as I had gotten comfortable in Mercer Island, I ended up
moving again. I wanted to purchase a house at this point, and got
lucky and closed on a deal that got me a place in West Seattle. So,
ended up packing this poor desk yet again. This time it was
fortunately quite a bit easier.

## February - The best server home - West Seattle, WA

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row">

One of the advantages of moving was that I now had a basement to store
the server in. No more crowded closets or trying to figure out
networking in a place where I can't drill holes!

## June - A better audio setup - West Seattle, WA

I also finally committed to building a proper setup for managing my
audio. The major issue I had before was that I couldn't really use my
computer audio and listen to my turntable through my headphones at the
same time. So I bought a mixer, added a DAC for my computer audio, and
got a better set of headphones too. That ended up solving most of my
problems.

<img src="/photos/workstation/2021-audio-setup.jpg" style="border: 3px solid #EEE;" />

For those interested, here's what I bought:

* Headphones: [Sennheiser HD 6XX](https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-sennheiser-hd6xx)
* Headphone Amp: [Schiit Audio Vali 2](https://www.schiit.com/products/vali-3)
* DAC: [Schiit Modius](https://www.schiit.com/products/modius)
* Mixer: [Mackie Mix8 8-Channel Compact Mixer with Studio-Level Audio Quality](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ND1KGEI)

## August - The ultimate setup - West Seattle, WA

<img src="/photos/workstation/2021-the-ultimate-setup.jpg" style="border: 3px solid #EEE;" />

Apparently I finally took the time to take a picture of the whole
thing. I also added an extra monitor in the meantime, because that was
definitely the biggest limiter to my workflow before.

For those considering a fourth monitor: I HEAVILY recommend stacking
them rather than just having them sit horizontally like this. Using
all of the monitors at once was a neck killer.

## September - A new keyboard - West Seattle, WA

<img src="/photos/workstation/2021-new-keyboard.jpg" style="border: 3px solid #EEE;" />

On that note, I actually did go ahead and stack my monitors. That
really saved my neck, although I will admit I don't use the top
monitor as often anymore.

Biggest change in my life was getting the [Kinesis
Advantage2](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/) keyboard. I had
noticed that after intense coding sessions with Emacs, my hands would
hurt terribly. For the sake of avoiding carpal tunnel, I went ahead
and changed keyboard to something that would make it a bit easier to
use modifier keys.

I decided on the Advantage2 as, while it was an awkward configuration,
it inluded more buttons in the thumb position which I knew would help
solve my biggest problem.

# 2022

## April - Moving yet again! - Fort Lauderdale, FL

<img src="/photos/workstation/2022-even-better.jpg" style="border: 3px solid #EEE;" />

And of course, the moment I settled in West Seattle, I decided to make
yet another move. It wasn't due to disliking Seattle but I saw that
the window for purchasing in South Florida was shrinking so I decided
to jump on the opportunity when the numbers worked out. Of course, I
had another cross-country move and another few weeks working in much
more barebones conditions. This picture was taken the day I got to
stop working on the kitchen cabinet.

I got a new standing desk, mainly because I was tired of moving the
big desk from one place to another. This one actually ended up being
really cheap to DIY.

# 2023

## January - A clean setup - Fort Lauderdale, FL

<img src="/photos/workstation/2023-the-newest-setup.jpg" style="border: 3px solid #EEE;" />

I finally decided to do some proper wire management below my desk so I
could use the standing desk feature. I brought in yet another server
rack for my wire management, but this time no annoying fans. I also
upgraded the turntable with a [Pioneer DJ PLX-500 Direct Drive
Turntable](https://www.pioneerdj.com/en-us/product/player/plx-500/black/overview/). It's
definitely a nice upgrade, although I need a better preamp.

That's it so far. I don't know what else I'll do to transform my
setup, but I'm sure I'll come up with something clever over the next
few years.
