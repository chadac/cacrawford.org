Hi! I'm Chad, a software developer with an interest in basically
everything computer-related. Right now I'm using primarily
[Nix](https://nixos.org) (that's how this website is built) and I
write a lot of [Python](https://www.python.org/).

This is a place for me to record my thoughts. Mainly for my own
edification, as they're usually a lot more unstructured before they
come out of my head. If you find any of it useful feel free to let me
know at [chad@cacrawford.org](mailto:chad@cacrawford.org).
