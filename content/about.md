Hi! I'm currently a Data Engineer at Amazon, previously a Data
Scientist at ExxonMobil, and before that, a Master's
student/researcher at the Univerity of Tulsa advised by [Dr. Sandip
Sen](http://www.ens.utulsa.edu/~sandip/). My interests are in big data
management, probabilistic modeling, and multi-agent
simulation. I've also got some web design experience with
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and
[React](https://reactjs.org/). You can check out my
[projects](/projects) to see the stuff I've done.

My main interest right now is in the design of engineering-focused
Machine Learning workflows. Many data scientists are often introduced
to software engineering without learning many core concepts about
writing reliable and easy-to-read code. There are many lessons in
software engineering that can help scientists both write better code
and build more reliable models. See [our group for some articles that
we've written in this
regard](https://medium.com/python-template-for-machine-learning-projects).

That's enough about me. What I'd really like to talk about right now
is my cats. One is a grey striped tabby cat named Thor (pictured
left), and the other is a small ragdoll cat named Robby (on the right,
short for ``Dread Cat Roberts'').

<img src="/photos/thor-1.jpg" style="border: 2px solid #BBB; width:

the cutest animals in the world. They are so cute and amazing, even
when they are in murder mode. So, if you're planning on getting a cat,
there are probably a few things that you need to know.

First, it's pretty cute when they're kittens and they bite your hand
and all, but it hurts when their teeth get sharp. If I hold my hand
outstretched, in front of the cats now, it triggers them to go into
psycho killer mode and attack the hand, probably because they can
shred my arm with their legs while tearing my hand apart. Still cute
tho, so do whatever you like.  <img src="/photos/robby-1.jpg"

Second, if you stare at them with big eyes, that makes them go into
psycho killer mode too. It's pretty cute and cats love to go into
psycho killer mode, so I'd recommend it.

Finally, somebody told me once that cats get fat if you leave food
around for them. The cat definition of fat must be totally different
from the dog definition because we've been feeding ours like that for
years and both still look great. We gave our beagle one of those
automatic dog food dispensers one time and they exploded in like a
week or something.

And finally finally, there's something right below Robby in the
picture on the right and I have no idea what it is. It looks like a
snake or something, but it probably isn't because I don't remember a
snake being in that picture. After zooming in a bit, though, it looks
like a ball with a shadow or something. No idea where that ball is now.

But Thor is definitely closer to the killer cat type cat. Ragdolls are
apparently supposed to be pretty docile, and while Robby isn't docile,
he does tolerate being held.
