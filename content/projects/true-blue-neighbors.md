A combined Wordpress Template/Plugin that helps volunteers track
hourly contributions to service opportunities made through the True
Blue Neighbors organization. This was about a several months long
project that involved developing a utility that would also
administrators, event organizers and students effectively collaborate
and manage their events.

I was the primary developer for this project, and implemented it in
PHP with WordPress.
