I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Tulsa, advised
by [Dr. Sandip Sen](http://www.ens.utulsa.edu/~sandip/). My research
interests are in machine learning, probabilistic modeling, adaptive
agents, and multi-agent simulation.

That's enough about me. What I'd really like to talk about right now
is my cats. One is a grey tabby cat named Thor, and the other is a
small ragdoll cat named Robbie.

Cats are probably the cutest animals in the world. They are so cute
and amazing, even when they are in murder mode. I'm eventually going
to add pictures, but who has time post pictures online when they're
living the pictures?
