title: "My Workstation over the Years"
---

Apparently over the years I've gotten into heavily customizing my
workstation, and it pretty much dominates the photos 

# 2014

## September - The University of Tulsa - Tulsa, OK

<img src="/photos/workstation/2014.jpg" style="border: 3px solid #EEE;" />

I'm pretty sure I was taking a picture of the Peanuts photo above my
desk. But you can at least still see my workstation setup: two
monitors, a bad keyboard, a mess on the desk (which is apparently the
only thing I keep consistent between photos) and Windows.

I was using Linux regularly at this time, but swapped to Windows for
gaming.

# 2015

## June - The University of Tulsa - Tulsa, OK

<img src="/photos/workstation/2015.png" style="border: 3px solid #EEE;" />

While living in Tulsa, Oklahoma at the University of Tulsa. The
machine on the right was a desktop that I had been using for years at
that point (I believe built in 2012) with specs I definitely don't
have any longer.

The desk came from my Dad from the Container Store. It was a bit
wobbly but did its job.

At the time I was running on Xubuntu with Xmonad as my Window Manager
and only about a year later did I finally start recording my system
config in [some
dotfiles](https://github.com/chadac/dotfiles/tree/00d02ac521cd86e85043c622dee1ce525098ad63).

# 2018

## March - PhD studies - Tulsa, OK

<img src="/photos/workstation/2018-1.png" style="border: 3px solid #EEE;" />

Moved into my friend's house. It's the same machine but for some
stupid reason I replaced all of the fans with cheaper stuff that had
annoying lights. Added a new monitor, 144hx and 1440p.

By 2018 I was running on Arch Linux and using i3 as my WM.

## November - Still a postgrad - Tulsa, OK

<img src="/photos/workstation/2018-2.png" style="border: 3px solid #EEE;" />

Upgraded the speakers to bookshelf speakers, and since they didn't fit
on my tiny desk I had to raise them with some books. I moved out of
this place around February 2019.

# 2019

## April - Working at Exxon - The Woodlands, TX

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
<img src="/photos/workstation/2019-1.jpg" style="border: 3px solid #EEE; display: inline; float: left; margin: 0 10px 0 0;" height="400px"  />

A few months after I started work at Exxon. I got a nice L-shaped
standing desk, and it ended up being free as it came scratched Wayfair
didn't want to pay the return costs I guess. You can barely tell here
but this is three monitors.

## July - Working at Exxon - The Woodlands, TX

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">

A few months later, I added a rug. Looks quite a bit nicer I
think. Eventually I got a NAS (pictured bedlow) which eventually
turned into a whole setup.

## November - The mess grows... - The Woodlands, TX

Got yet another desktop for some stuff to run continuously, sitting on
top of my NAS. It was at this point that I realized I probably should
just buy a rack to store everything on top of.

# 2020

## January - The server rack - The Woodlands, TX

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; width: 100%;">

Put a server rack in my closet with an insanely loud switch that I
still use to this day. I got something ridiculous like 30U because I
was planning to add more to this stuff over time. Also added some HPE
nodes because I wanted something dedicated to run my virtual machines
that wasn't also a NAS.

## March - Cross country move! - Mercer Island, WA

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">

In March, I moved from Houston to the Seattle area in Washington to
work for Amazon. Funny enough, the week I started was also the week
everything shut down due to COVID. I never actually went in physically
to work for a year, although I think the move was still worth it. The
house was located on the border of Mercer Island, with a magnificent
view of Lake Washington and a close view of downtown. Perfect place to
work when I'm stuck at home all day. Although it took over a month to
unpack all of those boxes...

</div>

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
<img src="/photos/workstation/2020-the-new-place.jpg" style="border: 3px solid #EEE; width: 50%;" />
<img src="/photos/workstation/2020-the-move.jpg" style="border: 3px solid #EEE; width: 50%; border-left: 0;"  />
</div>

## March - The desk is set up! - Mercer Island, WA

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; width: 100%;">
<img src="/photos/workstation/2020-a-better-desk.jpg" style="margin-right: 10px; display: inline; border: 3px solid #EEE; width: 100%;" />
This was trimmed down to something more acceptable. Wire
management still needed some work, but fortunately...
</div>

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
...the massive server behind it was a convenient place to hide those wires.
Effective wire hiding not pictured here.

Nonetheless, there was something missing...

NOW I've gone off the deep end.
