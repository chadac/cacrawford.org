These are the assignments meant for students taking the CS 4253
course. Assignments are expected to be done in Python 3.

My work was in creating a format and general library for students to
make implementation and visualization of particular assignments
simpler. The purpose behind this work was to introduce students to a
wide array of Python 3 libraries and skills necessary to distribute
Python applications.

For example, [Project
2](https://github.com/TUmasters/cs4253/tree/master/src/projects/proj2)
includes a pygame-based framework for automated agents to play games,
where a discretized soccer game and Connect 4 are available. To
emphasize the importance of functional programming and recursion in
the development of the Game Tree search algorithm, the state of the
game is stored in a persistent data structure (using
[pyrsistent](https://github.com/tobgu/pyrsistent)).

I have also developed several other helper tools -- in the genetic
algorithms assignment, students are given a noisy n-dimensional
function. The students are also able to visualize what this function
looks like on a 2-dimensional plane using
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).
